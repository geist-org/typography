## How to start

`@geist-ui/typography` consists of `themes` and `typography`. Package `themes` is the basic variables, Package `typography` is the text styles.

  2. Import:
  ```js
  import '@geist-ui/themes'
  import '@geist-ui/typography'

### Used by CDN

Sometimes you just need a simple project, like only one `.html` file,
you can choose the packaged UMD file on CDN (the umd package is still mini, ≈≈ 1kb):

  ```
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@geist-ui/typography@latest/umd.css"></script>
  ```
